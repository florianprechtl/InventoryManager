# InventoryManager

This project was created completely with PHP in collaboration with my french friend and study college Jix.

# Project environment

It was implemented for a PHP/Database course at the Laurea University of Applied Science. It was a final project to show what we learned in this course.

# The Project - MyFridge

Often you're standing at the grocery store beeing unsure if you're having a specific ingredient in your refridgerator or not. With **MyFridge** you can keep track of your inventory with your mobile or desktop device. One thing less to worry about!

You can:
* add/delete/update ingredients 
* upload your own pictures of the things you want to keep track of
* reuse previously added ingredients
