- don't forget the ' in your sql request if you're using variables that will be used as chars  -> will break your neck
- don't forget the _ in $_POST
- always keep in mind that the smallest typos will break your neck, especially if it's something like "name_descr = name_descr"
- never forget the $ infornt of variables. Otherwise you will get crazy resuts if you e.g. try to access an array -> then the variable name without $ will be seen as string
