- productgroup = unuseful and complicated -> yes it has been removed 

- if the same product appears twice because of a difference into the expiring date, do we distinguish it in two products 
or do we join them in the same ? -> it's ok we dont have to deal with that 

- problem of non logical example : 
we have amount of Leeks = 6 and unit = kg. We consider that there are 6 leeks in the fridge or 6kg of leeks ?
==> 6kg ==> so it's the same for tomatoes etc, it is not unity 
=> maybe we can introduce a "piece" as a unity -> then we can consider that we have 6 leeks 
----> the user can now change and update the product info so he can choose to modify the unit : problem solved
